# Simple analysis using python

The idea of this project is to create a small and "simple" python application that will allow the user to
analyse Excel files. 

The user interface should allow the user to select a file to charge.
Once the file is charge, the application should analyse it and display information about
the quantitative variables, such as:
- minimum
- maximum
- median
- 1st quartile
- 3rd quartile
- average

(the five first are call `five-number-summary`)

It should allow the use to select 2 quantitative variables and plot a charts of the relation between them.

The idea of the application will be developed further as the project goes.

# To-Do:
- [ ] Create a user interface (ongoing)
- [x] display button to select Excel file
- [x] charge the file into the application (pandas DataFrame)
- [x] analyse the fields and display summary if quantitative variables
- [x] display button (only if data is charged) that will allow the user to select two fields 
and plot the relation between
- [X] add selection buttons once the data has been loaded
- [X] draw chart for selected quantitative variables


The To-Do list is quite simplistic for now but I will update it as the project develop.
